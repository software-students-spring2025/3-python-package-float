      "Python doesn’t require explicit declaration of variable types. It’s dynamically typed, so you can assign a variable with an integer and later reassign it to a string without any issues.",

      "Pip: Python’s package manager, 'pip,' is a playful acronym that stands for 'Pip Installs Packages.'",
      "Jupyter Notebooks: These are interactive notebooks that allow you to combine code, text, and visualizations in one document—perfect for data science and teaching."

      "Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991!",
      "Python is named after the British comedy group Monty Python, not the snake!",
      "Python 2 was officially discontinued in 2020, with Python 3 being the main version now.",
      "Python's standard library is vast and is often described as being 'batteries included' because it comes with many built-in modules.",
      "Python has one of the largest programming communities in the world, making it easier to find help, tutorials, and libraries."

   "performance": [
       "Python can be optimized with Cython, a language that is a superset of Python and allows you to write C-like performance code that can run alongside Python.",
       "Tools like PyPy allow for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of Python code, which can significantly speed up performance.",
       "Python handles memory management automatically using a garbage collector, which cleans up unused objects to avoid memory leaks."
